    jobs:
      - company: Strypes
        product: "3D Fashion Configurator"
        title: "Cofounder and CTO"
        description: >-
          Strypes' software is used to allow retail fashion brands unprecedented levels of customization for their 
          products through a realistic 3D game-like experience. 
          

          As Strypes' CTO, I led the technology charge, building and managing a team to solve the myriad of 
          problems involved in bringing video game tech to the fashion retail space, including efficient 3D product digitization,
          novel UI/UX design, and in-browser real-time 3D rendering to name a few.


          I balanced my time between coding, project management, code review, engineering managment, UI/UX design, investor outreach, and customer support.

      - company: Zynga
        product: FarmVille 2
        title: "Senior Software Engineer"
        description: >-
          I designed, prototyped and implemented large scale features in FarmVille 2 (a sandbox farming simulator game).


          Most notably, I led a team of 6 to build the "State Fair" feature, which changed the game from a single-player 
          sandbox game, to a competitive multiplayer game in the form of a weekly recurring tournament.
          

          This involved building out matchmaking, leaderboards, social communication, and scaling the system to 
          handle 1.5 million users.

      - company: Microsoft
        product: Xbox & Kinect
        title: "Software Engineer"
        description: >-
          I joined the Xbox team right as we got our hands on the Kinect alpha hardware when no one knew what to do with it.


          I did rapid prototyping and implementation to integrate the Kinect motion sensing camera seamlessly into the Xbox's dashboard.
          This involved gesture recognition (for which I hold a <a href="https://bit.ly/2sSnyvq">patent</a>), 
          voice recognition, and UI/UX design and implementation. 
          

          My software went on to ship to 56 million consoles, and the Kinect won the title of 
          <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-selling-gaming-peripheral/">"Fastest selling gaming peripheral"</a>
          in the Guiness Book of World Records.

      - title: Mandelbrot Set Zoomer
        description: >-
          This program is a visualizer for the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html">Mandelbrot Set</a>.


          I love the beauty and complexity that can come out of this simple equation:
            
          <i>z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</i>
          

          This program is capable of being used interactively to dive into the fractal wherever you like,
          or in headless mode, which spits out all the frames of a video zooming into a specific point in the set.

      - title: Koch Snowflake
        description: >-
          The <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KochSnowflake.html">Koch Snowflake</a> is another well known fractal
          that is generated from inserting 2/3rds of an equalateral triangle into the middle third of each line segment each
          iteration.


          One fascinating property of this structure is that if you were to iterate an infinite number of times, it would
          have an infinitely sized perimeter, but still be contained within a finite area.


          I wanted to visualize and animate this fractal as it grows more complex with iteration, and the animation here
          is the result.

      - title: Wave Interference Patterns
        description: >-
          This program visualizes 2 ripple waves colliding with each other.


          I wanted to create something beautiful using only ellipses, and after much experimentation and iteration
          I came across this pattern which you can see interact in the demo below.
