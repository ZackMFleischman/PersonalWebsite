    jobs:
      - company: Strypes
        product: "3D Fashion Configurator"
        title: "Cofounder and CTO"
        description: >-
          Strypes' software is used to allow retail fashion brands unprecedented levels of customization for their 
          products through a realistic 3D game-like experience. 
          

          As Strypes' CTO, I am leading the technology charge, building and managing a team to solve the myriad 
          problems involved in bringing video game tech to the retail space, including efficient 3D product digitization,
          novel UI/UX design, and in-browser real-time 3D rendering to name a few.


          I balance my time between coding, project management, code review, engineering managment, UI/UX design, investor outreach, and customer support.

      - company: Zynga
        product: FarmVille 2
        title: "Senior Software Engineer"
        description: >-
          I designed, prototyped and implemented large scale features in FarmVille 2 (a sandbox farming simulator game).


          Most notably, I led a team of 6 to build the "State Fair" feature, which changed the game from a single-player 
          sandbox game, to a competitive multiplayer game in the form of a weekly recurring tournament.
          

          This involved building out matchmaking, leaderboards, social communication, and scaling the system to 
          handle 1.5 million users.

      - company: Microsoft
        product: Xbox & Kinect
        title: "Software Engineer"
        description: >-
          I joined the Xbox team right as we got our hands on the Kinect alpha hardware when one knew what to do with it.


          I did rapid prototyping and implementation to integrate the Kinect motion sensing camera seamlessly into the Xbox's dashboard.
          This involved gesture recognition (for which I hold a <a href="https://bit.ly/2sSnyvq">patent</a>), 
          voice recognition, and UI/UX design and implementation. 
          

          My software went on to ship to 56 million consoles, and the Kinect won the title of 
          <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-selling-gaming-peripheral/">"Fastest selling gaming peripheral"</a>
          in the Guiness Book of World Records.
